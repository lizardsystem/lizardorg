Lizard.org website project
==========================

Goal: have a small site that points at the **developer-relevant** information
on Lizard.

The big part of the documentation should be somewhere on
http://readthedocs.org, this site is only to have a landing page showing the
way. And a little bit PR, like a video and pointers at blogs and
presentations.
